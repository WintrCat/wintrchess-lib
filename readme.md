# 📚 WintrChess Library

Library with Chess operations and tools for WintrChess.

###### For the time being, documentation is provided via JSDoc.

## Subpackages
`wintrchess/engine` - Classes for interacting with UCI engines and analysis related functions.

`wintrchess/commentary` - Natural language move and position explanations, using an engine and traditional code; an LLM is used only for language construction.

`wintrchess/classify` **(WIP)** - Move classifications (brilliant, blunder etc.)

`wintrchess/utils` - Utility functions for random Chess stuff.

`wintrchess/types` - All the miscellaneous TypeScript types.

> [!NOTE]
> This is not currently in use on the live WintrChess deployment.
> But it will be eventually! ✨
